# codeassignment
1)Structure of the project

To start with, I have created basically a master interface under package "code_assignment.interfaces" --> IAnimal.java
from which all types of animals will be derived. I have further created interfaces depending on the behaviour -> fly,walk,sing,swim

IFlyingAnimal.java
ISingingAnimal.java
ISwimmingAnimal.java
IWalkingAnimal.java

Following this, there are Abstract classes under package "code_assignment.abs" for Parrots and fishes
AFish.java
AParrot.java

All main classes (including Solution files, Builder and Factories) are in default package "code_assignment"


All concrete object classes under "code_assignment.obj" pacakge

Unit Test for Solution 1 is under package "code_assignment.unit_tests"


The solution for E. Counting animals is in the main file "AnimalCountProcessor.java" under default package "code_assignment"

I have also generated the javadoc for the project under "codeassignment/code_assignment/doc/"  folder path.

Thank You..
